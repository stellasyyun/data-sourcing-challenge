# Data Sourcing Challenge

For this challenge, I showed how to fetch data from an API with correct query variables, format API responses into Pandas DataFrame, and modify them by needs. I was able to convert data types of certain columns into string so that I can apply string function to filter out only the data that includes certain word in it. I also created a custom function to spread out data for columns that came in a list of items. Same modification could also be done by using `explode()` function. Lastly, I could merge two different datasets into one and make a new column that calculated their differences.
